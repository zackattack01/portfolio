          I'm currently working on building a lightweight framework (modeled after rails and active record) to better understand 
          and appreciate their inner workings.  So far I've implemented macros for defining all of the basic relationships (has_many, belongs_to, has_many through, etc.)
          as well as base model and controller classes to provide utility methods for interacting with SQL.</p>
        <p>  
          The next step was to create asset controllers with custom routes
          to recognize and respond to requests for images (.png, .jpeg, .jpg) as well as scripts and stylesheets.  The framework can now be (and has been) fully integrated with jQuery, 
          Bootstrap, and Backbone.  The website you're viewing right now is built on that framework, and you've actually been sitting on a gold mine of poke data this entire time.

        <p>
          Another recent project of mine is breedly, an rss feed reading app inspired by feedly. Breedly tailors to users that have a personal
          blog or feed that they want to share.  You don't need one to sign up, but once you do you can add public or personal feeds to the database and manage your feed subscriptions.
          Adding interests to your profile will suggest other feeds that you might be interested in, and you can search for feeds by title or topic.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Breedly dynamically associates feeds with categories from their latest entries and escapes html intelligently to maintain the integrity of responses from whitelisted sources.  
          This allows full support for embedded YouTube and mp4 videos as well as media from Instagram, iTunes, and Tumblr.  Click the logo above to check it out live.

        <p>
          Snake is a fast-paced javascript game I created based on Atari’s Snake.
        </p>
        <p>
          It uses CSS repeating and radial gradients to produce a snake scale texture and give depth to the targets.
          The view constructor integrates modal presentations with Javascript’s async interval methods to allow smooth pausing
          and game restart.  Click the logo above to try it out.
