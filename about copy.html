			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p>I'm Zack, a native of Rochester New York and the oldest of four boys.  When I'm not coding I enjoy playing soccer, working out, and finding adventures/shenanigans/funtivities in general.</p>
			<p>
				I graduated from SUNY Geneseo with Bachelor's degrees in Psychology and Philosophy.  My coursework heavily emphasized logic, statistics, and cognitive neuropsych.  While taking a stats course for my research lab I was introduced to R, and 
			  this is where my brain finally found its home in coding.  I'm experienced in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, jQuery, Backbone, HTML, CSS, git, Rspec, and SQL, and I'm interested in adding as many skills to this list as I can.
